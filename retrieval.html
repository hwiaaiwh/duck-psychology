      <h2>Misinformation Effect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The distortion of a past memory with an external suggestion and/or misinformation.</li>
        <li>E.g. You remember that the cars were faster when it crashed because everyone else implied it was, but in reality the cars were slower and the crash was less severe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Source Amnesia</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Inability to recall origin of memory but retain the main information</li>
          <li>E.g. Remembering a certain character's quote but not remembering who that character is or what show they came from.</li>
